# California financial disclosure data

Structured and cleaned financial disclosure data for California legislators from [Form 700](https://form700search.fppc.ca.gov/) filings.

[![Scrape financial disclosure data](https://github.com/CalMatters/ca-form-700-data/actions/workflows/scrape.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CalMatters/ca-form-700-data/actions/workflows/scrape.yml)

## Methodology

The data is extracted by journalists from the legislator-submitted PDF versions of the forms which are downloaded from the FPPC. We attempt to match the reported information on the form to the extent possible.

All of the names of people and organizations are subsequently normalized so that the data is easily compared and grouped. This is done with a two column lookup table per data schedule managed as a Google spreadsheet which is linked below with the cleaned data column.

## Data files

There are three CSV files generated and each is based on a section, called a "schedule", in the FPPC form.

### Investments - Schedule A1

Here is the data dictionary for the `schedule-a1.csv` file.

#### Things to look out for when working with gift data

Some legislators reported taking gifts that exceeded the FPPC's annual per-source limit ($520 in 2022) and included a note that says they returned the part of the gift exceeding the amount. This note isn't captured anywhere in our data, so if you notice anybody reporting a haul over the legal limit you should also look at the submitted form to confirm the legislator didn't return part of the gift. You can use the PDF available in the `formUrl` column for each gift.

Asm. Marie Waldron reported a gift total of over $3k in [her 2022 form](https://wcfweenxfcmsichcbyki.supabase.in/storage/v1/object/public/pdfs/eabd7aeb-88ee-481d-9d4e-a7e215bb665e.pdf) but it appears to be travel that should have been reported in Schedule E instead. CalMatters reached out to her office for clarification but has yet to hear back.
